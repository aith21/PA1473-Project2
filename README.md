# PA1473 - Group 16 - Software Development: Agile Project


## Introduction

In this project we (a group of five) have been working with a Lego Robot, and programmed it, using python, to be able to do certain things that the customer has demanded, using user stories.


## Getting started

For this project, all you need in Visual Studio code, and the "LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 MicroPython" Extention. We also used Trello to keep track of the user stories given by the customer, and then had a github repository. Obviously you will need a Lego Mindstorm EV3 aswell.


## Building and running

The program is menu-based so that the user can choose what to do hence there is a manual input. When starting the program, the robot will make itself ready before allowing the user to access the menu. The program accepts different arguments to do different things, by having it either pick up something, or drop of something. The menu also have the option to toggle different things such as the color checking.


## Features


- [x] US01B: As a customer, I want the robot to pick up items from a designated position
- [x] US02B: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at a designated position.
- [x] US04B: As a customer, I want the robot to tell me the color of an item at a designated position.
- [x] US05: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at different locations based on the color of the item.
- [x] US06: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to pick up items from elevated positions.
- [ ] US03: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to determine if an item is present at a given location.
- [ ] US09: As a customer, I want the robot to check the pickup location periodically to see if a new item has arrived.
- [ ] US12: As a customer, I want to be able to manually set the locations and heights of one pick-up zone and two             drop-off zones. (Implemented either by manually dragging the arm to a position or using buttons)
- [ ] US08B As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate items with three different colors and drop the items off at specific drop-off zones based on color.
- [ ] US10: As a customer, I want the robots to sort items at a specific time.
- [ ] US11: As a customer, I want two robots to communicate and work together on items sorting without colliding with each other.
